1. Why is the fs core module important for Node development?

Server-side languages must provide a way to access the file system through code. In Node, 
fs serves this purpose.


2. What is the difference between sync and non-sync methods in the fs module?

Sync: synchronous or blocking, means that your code runs in sequential order.  The program waits for the
line of code to finish executing before moving on to the next line of code.

Non-sync: asynchronous or non-blocking, means your code does not wait for the current line to execute before
moving on to run the next line.

3. Why are modules used?

Module is the name for libraries in Node.  Modules are libraries, mainly pieces of code, that are imported
into a file.  Modules are used as a way to access and include external libraries into Node. Using these 
libraries, we can create servers, read and write files, and access other JavaScript libraries.

4. Why are libraries such as fs used in Node programming?

Libraries such as fs provide increased functionality in Node programming. Some common uses of fs are
read, create, update, delete, rename and upload files.  Using a good library is useful because you
can utilize code created and tested by good developers and is maintained by a community.
