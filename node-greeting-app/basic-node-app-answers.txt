1. What is a Node module?

A Node module is a set of functions to include in your application. You 
can consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

While both have the same core function, module.exports should only be used 
over exports when we plan for our object to have specific type.

3. Why is using exports recommended?

When using module.exports assignment operations will generate  errors in 
our app but if we use exports we won't have that issue.
